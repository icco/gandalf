A beautiful woman stands alone in the street. It has rained recently, and the lights of the city are slowly switching on. A sunset and neon reflect off of the puddles surrounding her.

She stares intently at her phone. A homeless man stares at her from a distance. He wonders, why does the light from this small box hold her attention so consistently? Is it a friend? A sexual interest? A map? Or some pointless article on the internet?

The man’s thoughts begin to drift. Some thought triggers a memory of adventures past. Back when his magic was stronger, his purpose greater. He misses that old world. He was still a vagabond, but he was respected. He dined with kings and ended wars. Only his staff and his beard are the same. How he misses that grey cloak, back from that fateful battle, before it was all burnt off and he became much more important, if only for a short time.

As the memories of one of his greatest failure started to enter his mind, he shakes his head and glances up, the woman now embracing another woman, who is shorter, in a black skirt instead of jeans. They laugh, and walk into a store.

A young man tosses some yen coins into the coffee cup in-front of the vagabond. The young man nods and points a thumb over his shoulder as he walks away. The police are walking towards him, but haven’t seen him yet.

He slowly stands, grabbing his cup and making it and the money vanish. He checks his grey sweatshirt, tan shorts and orange baseball cap, steadies himself with his staff, and hobbles barefoot out of his alcove and onto the streets of Tokyo.

[TITLE]

The old man wanders the city, he stops in parks and sits on benches for hours lost in thought. He lives off of vending machines and the generocity of others, always slowly shuffling. Some know him, he'll help out in markets, randomly freeing cats from trees, providing lighters to smokers, small courtesies to the common man.
